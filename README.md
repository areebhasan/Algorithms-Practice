# Java Algorithms Practice in Visual Studio Code

Welcome to the Java Algorithms Practice repository, a curated collection of algorithmic solutions developed in Visual Studio Code. This repository serves as a showcase of algorithmic problem-solving skills in Java, ideal for both learning and reference purposes.

## Getting Started

This repository is set up in a simple and easy-to-navigate structure, making it straightforward for you to explore and run Java solutions for various algorithmic problems.

## Repository Structure

Here's a brief overview of the repository's structure:

- `src`: This folder contains the source code for all algorithmic solutions. Each algorithm is implemented in its own Java file, making it easy to understand and execute.
- `lib`: If any external libraries or dependencies are used in the project, they are maintained in this folder.
- `bin`: This folder is where the compiled Java bytecode files (`*.class`) are stored. It's auto-generated when you build the project.

**Note**: The folder structure can be customized in Visual Studio Code by modifying the `.vscode/settings.json` file.

## Algorithms Included

In this repository, you will find Java implementations of various classic and modern algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Longest Palindromic Substring (`LongestPalindromicSubstring.java`)
- Reverse Integer (`ReverseInteger.java`)
- Add Two Numbers (`AddTwoNum.java`)
- Two Sum (`TwoSum.java`)
- Palindrome Number (`PlalindromeNumber.java`)

Each algorithm is accompanied by a brief comment at the top of its source file, explaining its purpose and the problem it solves.

## Running the Code

To run any of the algorithms:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Navigate to the `src` folder and open the Java file you wish to run.
4. Run the file using Visual Studio Code's built-in Java support.

## Dependency Management

Dependencies in this project are managed through the `JAVA PROJECTS` view in Visual Studio Code. For more details on managing Java dependencies in Visual Studio Code, visit [this guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
